# Redux

**Counter:** This app adds or subtracts custom values using Redux. No UI element is currently present so the app must be viewed in the terminal.

**Redux Counter:** This app builds on my intial redux knowledge and applies it to a react framework in order to display a UI to the user. The user can add by 1, subtract by 1, add by 10, subtract by 10, multiple by 100, divide by 100 and reset the counter to 0.
